## The Migration of Functionality to Microcode

  Once microprogramming had become common (by 1970), designers realized
  that they could add new instructions by just extending the microprogram. In other
  words, they could add ‘‘hardware’’ (new machine instructions) by programming.


  → 마이크로프로그램을 확장함으로써 새로운 명령어들을 추가할수 있음을 설계자들은 깨달았고
  → 다른 말로는, 프로그래그래밍으로 하드웨어(새로운 기계 명령어들)를 추가할 수 있었음을 말한다.


  This revelation led to a virtual explosion in machine instruction sets, as designers
  competed with one another to produce bigger and better instruction sets. Many of
  these instructions were not essential in the sense that their effect could be easily
  achieved by existing instructions, but often they were slightly faster than a se-
  quence of existing instructions. For example, many machines had an instruction
  INC (INCrement) that added 1 to a number. Since these machines also had a gener-
  al ADD instruction, having a special instruction to add 1 (or to add 720, for that
  matter) was not necessary. However, the INC was usually a little faster than the
  ADD, so it got thrown in.
  이러한 사실은 기계 명령어 셋의 가상적인 증가를 이끌었다. 이에 따라서 설계자들은 더 많은 더 좋은 명령어 셋을 생상하는 것을 겨루었다.


  For the same reason, many other instructions were added to the microprogram.
  그런 이유로 , 많은 다른 명령어들은 마이크로 프로그램에 추가되었다.
  These often included
  그러한 것은 종종 포함한다.

  1. Instructions for integer multiplication and division.
    Integet 곱셉 그리고 나누기를 위한 명령어들.
  2. Floating-point arithmetic instructions.
    소수점 연산 수학 명령어들.

  3. Instructions for calling and returning from procedures.
    프로시져들로부터의 리턴과 호출에 대한 명령어들.
  4. Instructions for speeding up looping.
    반복의 속도를 위한 명령어.
  5. Instructions for handling character strings.
    문자열 String들을 다루는 명령어셋

  Furthermore, once machine designers saw how easy it was to add new instructions,
  they began looking around for other features to add to their microprograms. A few
  examples of these additions include
  더군다나, 기계 설꼐자는 새로운 명령어들을 추가하는 방법을 알기 쉽기 때문에 , 그들은 마이크로프로그램에 다른 추가하는 또라는 특징을 찾기 시작한다.
  그러한 추가에 대한 예들을 다음을 포함한다.

  1. Features to speed up computations involving arrays (indexing and
  indirect addressing).
    배열들을 포함하는 연산의 속도를 높이는것 (인뎃싱과 간접적인 어드레싱).

  2. Features to permit programs to be moved in memory after they have
  started running (relocation facilities).
  프로그램이 실행된후 동작하고 있는데  메모리에서 움직이도록  허용하는 특징
  (설비 재배치)

  3. Interrupt systems that signal the computer as soon as an input or out-
  put operation is completed.  입력과 출력 명령에 바로 컴퓨터가 신호에 받는 인터럽트 시스템은 완전하다.

  4. The ability to suspend one program and start another in a small num-
  ber of instructions (process switching 프로세스 스위칭). 하나의 프로그램을 일시중지하고 또다른 프로그램이 아주 적은 명령어들로 시작하도록 하는 능력

  5. Special instructions for processing audio, image, and multimedia
  files. 소리, 이미지등 멀티미디어를 프로세싱하는 특정한 명령어들

  Numerous other features and facilities have been added over the years as well,
  usually for speeding up some particular activity.

## The Elimination of Microprogramming 마이크로 프로그래밍의 제거

  Microprograms grew fat during the golden years of microprogramming (1960s
  and 1970s). They also tended to get slower and slower as they acquired more bulk.
  Finally, some researchers realized that by eliminating the microprogram, vastly
  reducing the instruction set, and having the remaining instructions be directly ex-
  ecuted (i.e., hardware control of the data path), machines could be speeded up.

  → 마이크로 프로그램을 제거함으로써 많은 명령어셋을 줄이고 , 직접적으로 실행하는 것이 머신의 속도를 증가시킴을 알게됨.

  In a certain sense, computer design had come full circle, back to the way it was
  before Wilkes invented microprogramming in the first place.

  But the wheel is still turning. Modern processors still rely on microprogramming
  to translate complex instructions to internal microcode that can be executed directly on streamlined hardware.
  현대의 프로세서에서도 복잡한  내부의 마이크로 코트의 명령어셋을 해석하는 마이크로프로그램에 의존하고 있음.

  The point of this discussion is to show that the boundary between hardware
  and software is arbitrary and constantly changing. Today’s software may be
  tomorrow’s hardware, and vice versa. Furthermore, the boundaries between the
  various levels are also fluid. From the programmer’s point of view, how an instruction is actually implemented is unimportant (except perhaps for its speed).
  A person programming at the ISA level can use its multiply instruction as though it were a hardware instruction
  without having to worry about it, or even be aware of whether it really is a hardware instruction.
  One person’s hardware is another person’s software. We will come back to all these topics later in this book.

###  1.2 MILESTONES IN COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

  Hundreds of different kinds of computers have been designed and built during
  the evolution of the modern digital computer. Most have been long forgotten, but a
  few have had a significant impact on modern ideas. In this section we will give a
  brief sketch of some of the key historical developments in order to get a better un-
  derstanding of how we got where we are now. Needless to say, this section only
  touches on the highlights and leaves many stones unturned. Figure 1-4 lists some
  of the milestone machines to be discussed in this section. Slater (1987) is a good
  place to look for additional historical material on the people who founded the com-
  puter age. For short biographies and beautiful color photographs by Louis Fabian
  Bachrach of some of the key people who founded the computer age, see Morgan’s
  coffee-table book (1997).
